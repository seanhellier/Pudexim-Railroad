# train-scheduler

Pudexim Railroad is nmaed for my grandfather's legendary model train layout. The name is Mixedup Railroad, spelled backwards. He named it that because it included trains modeled from real trains in Europe, North Americ, and Asia.

The current time clock is not mine. I found the boilerplate code on the internet and included it.
