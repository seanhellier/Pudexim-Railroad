Pudexim Railroad is a javascript app name for my grandfather's legendary model train layout. (The name is Mixedup Railroad, spelled backwards. He named his layout that because it included trains modeled from real trains in Europe, North Americ, and Asia).

It is a javascript and moment.js app that allows one to schedule trains and see arrival and interval times.
